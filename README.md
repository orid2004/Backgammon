## Description
The backgammon game is developed for two backgammon players competing on the same screen,
each on their turn.  Along with each roll, the current player is notified. Each step is executed via left-click (read rules.pdf for better options). Prohibited moves are not executed. Turns aren't time limited. 

## Executable
The executable can be executed on DOSBox 0.74 and wasn't tested on other platforms.
